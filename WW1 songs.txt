Up to mighty London
Came an Irishman one day.
As the streets are paved with gold
Sure, everyone was gay,
Singing songs of Piccadilly,
Strand and Leicester Square,
Till Paddy got excited,
Then he shouted to them there:
It's a long way to Tipperary,
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary,
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye, Piccadilly,
Farewell, Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary,
But my heart's right there.
Paddy wrote a letter
To his Irish Molly-O,
Saying, "Should you not receive it,
Write and let me know!"
"If I make mistakes in spelling,
Molly, dear," said he,
"Remember, it's the pen that's bad,
Don't lay the blame on me!"
It's a long way to Tipperary,
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary,
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye, Piccadilly,
Farewell, Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary,
But my heart's right there.
Molly wrote a neat reply
To Irish Paddy-O,
Saying "Mike Maloney
Wants to marry me, and so
Leave the Strand and Piccadilly
Or you'll be to blame,
For love has fairly drove me silly:
Hoping you're the same!"
It's a long way to Tipperary,
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary,
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye, Piccadilly,
Farewell, Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary,
But my heart's right there.

Bombed last night and bombed the night before,
Going to get bombed tonight if we never get bombed any more.
When we're bombed we're scared as we can be.
God strafe the bombing planes from High Germany.
They're over us, they're over us,
One shell hole for just the four of us.
Thank your lucky stars there are no more of us,
Because one of us could fill it all alone.
Gassed last night and gassed the night before,
Going to get gassed tonight if we never get gassed any more.
When we're gassed we're sick as we can be,
Because phosgene and mustard gas is much too much for me.
They're warning us, they're warning us,
One respirator for the four of us.
Thank your lucky stars that three of us can run,
So one of us can use it all alone.

Brother Bertie went away
To do his bit the other day
With a smile on his lips
and his Lieutenant's pips
upon his shoulder bright and gay
As the train moved out he said,
'Remember me to all the birds.'
Then he wagged his paw
and went away to war
Shouting out these pathetic words:
Goodbye-ee, goodbye-ee,
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye-ee,
Though it's hard to part I know,
I'll be tickled to death to go.
Don't cry-ee, dont sigh-ee,
there's a silver lining in the sky-ee,
Bonsoir, old thing, cheer-i-o, chin, chin,
Nah-poo, toodle-oo, Goodbye-ee.
At the hospital at Kew,
The convalescents, dressed in blue,
Had to hear Lady Lee, who had turned 83,
Sing all the old, old songs she knew.
Then she made a speech and said,
"I look on you boys with pride,
And to thank you all I'm going to kiss each one",
Then they all grabbed a stick and cried,
Goodbye-ee, goodbye-ee,
Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye-ee,
Though it's hard to part I know,
I'll be tickled to death to go.
Don't cry-ee, dont sigh-ee,
there's a silver lining in the sky-ee,
Bonsoir, old thing, cheer-i-o, chin, chin,
Nah-poo, toodle-oo, Goodbye-ee.

If the sergeant drinks your rum, never mind
And your face may lose its smile, never mind
He's entitled to a tot but not the bleeding lot
If the sergeant drinks your rum, never mind
When old Jerry shells your trench, never mind
And your face may lose its smile, never mind
Though the sandbags bust and fly you have only once to die,
If old Jerry shells the trench, never mind
If you get stuck on the wire, never mind
And your face may lose its smile, never mind
Though you're stuck there all the day, they count you dead and stop your pay
If you get stuck on the wire, never mind
If your mate just lost his sight, never mind
And he screamed the whole damned night, never mind
‎Although they'll send him home it's tough, he'll be great for blind-man's bluff
So if your mate just lost his sight, never mind
If the sergeant says your mad, never mind
P'raps you are a little bit, never mind
Just be calm don't answer back, cause the sergeant stands no slack
So if he says you're mad, well - you are.‎

Mademoiselle from Armentieres,
She hasn't been kissed for forty years,
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
She got the palm and the croix de guerre,
For washing soldiers' underwear,
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
The Colonel got the Croix de Guerre,
The son-of-a-gun was never there!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
You didn't have to know her long,
To know the reason men go wrong!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
She's the hardest working girl in town,
But she makes her living upside down!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
The cooties rambled through her hair;
She whispered sweetly "C'est la guerre."
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
She'll do it for wine, she'll do it for rum,
And sometimes for chocolate or chewing gum!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
You might forget the gas and shell
But you'll never forget the Mademoiselle!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
Where are the girls who used to swarm
About me in my uniform?
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
The Mademoiselle from St. Nazaire,
She never washed her underwear.
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
Mademoiselle from Aix-Les-Bains,
She gave the Yankees shooting pains!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
As soon as she'd spy a Colonel's brass,
She'd take off her skirt and roll in the grass!
Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.

If you want to find the Sergeant,
I know where he is, I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want to find the Sergeant, I know where he is,
He's lying on the canteen floor.
I've seen him, I've seen him, lying on the canteen floor,
I've seen him, I've seen him, lying on the canteen floor.
If you want to find the Quarter-bloke
I know where he is, I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want to find the Quarter-bloke, I know where he is,
He's miles and miles behind the line.
I've seen him, I've seen him, miles and miles and miles behind the line.
I've seen him, I've seen him, miles and miles and miles behind the line.
If you want the Sergeant-major,
I know where he is, I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want the Sergeant-major, I know where he is.
He's tossing off the privates' rum.
I've seen him, I've seen him, tossing off the privates' rum.
I've seen him, I've seen him, tossing off the privates' rum.
If you want to find the C.O.,
I know where he is, I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want the C.O., I know where he is
He is down in a deep dug-out,
I've seen him, I've seen him, down in a deep dug-out,
I've seen him, I've seen him, down in a deep dug-out.
If you want the old battalion,
I know where they are, I know where they are, I know where they are
If you want to find the old battalion, I know where they are,
They're hanging on the old barbed wire,
I've seen them, I've seen them, hanging on the old barbed wire.
I've seen them, I've seen them, hanging on the old barbed wire

When this lousy war is over, no more soldiering for me,
When I get my civvy clothes on, oh how happy I shall be.
No more church parades on Sunday, no more putting in for leave,
I will miss the Sergeant-Major,
How he'll miss me how he'll grieve.
No more standing to in trenches,
Only one more church parade,
No more NCOs to curse us,
No more tickler's marmalade.
When this lousy war is over,
No more soldiering for me,
When I get my civvy clothes on,
Oh how happy I shall be.
People said when we enlisted,
Fame and medals we would win,
But the fame is in the guardroom,
And those medals made of tin.
When this lousy war is over,
No more soldiering for me,
When I get my civvy clothes on
Oh how happy I shall be.

Up to your waist in water,
Up to your eyes in slush,
Using the kind of language
That makes the sergeants blush;
Who wouldn't join the army,
That's what we all enquire,
Don't we pity the poor civilians
Sitting beside the fire ?
Oh! Oh! Oh! It's a lovely war,
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh ?
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay.
As soon as reveille has gone
We feel just as heavy as lead,
But we never get up till the sergeant
Brings our breakfast up to bed.
What do you want with eggs and ham
When you've got plum and apple jam ?
Form fours! Right turn!
How shall we spend the money we earn ?
Oh! Oh! Oh! It's a lovely war,
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh ?
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay.
When does a soldier grumble ?
When does a soldier make a fuss ?
No one is more contented
In all the world than us.
Oh, it's a cushy life, boys,
Really, we love it so;
Once a fellow was sent on leave
And simply refused to go.
Oh! Oh! Oh! It's a lovely war,
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh ?
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay.
Come to the cook-house door, boys,
Sniff at the lovely stew,
Who is it says the colonel
Gets better grub than you ?
Any complaints this morning?
Do we complain ? Not we.
What's the matter with lumps of onion
Floating around the tea ?
Oh! Oh! Oh! It's a lovely war,
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh ?
Oh, it's a shame to take the pay.

I don't want to join the army
I don't want to go to war.
I would rather hang around Picadilly's underground
And living off the earnings of a high born lady.
I don't want a bullet in me backside,
I don't want me arsehole shot away.
I would rather stay in Lunnon,
Jolly, jolly Lunnon
And fornicate me blooming life away, Gor Blimey.
Call out the Army and the Navy
Call out the rank and file.
Call out the brave Territorials
They face danger with a smile!
Call out the King's Militia
They kept England free!
Call out me brother
Me father or me mother
But for God's sake don't call me.
