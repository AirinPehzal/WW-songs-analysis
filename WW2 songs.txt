There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see
I'll never forget the people I met
Braving those angry skies
I remember well as the shadows fell
The light of hope in their eyes
And though I'm far away
I still can hear them say
Bombs up...
But when the dawn comes up
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see
There'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow
When the world is free
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see...

Outside the barracks, by the corner light
I'll always stand and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two
I'll wait for you the whole night through
For you, Lili Marlene
For you, Lili Marlene
Bugler, tonight, don't play the call to arms
I want another evening with her charms
Then we will say good-bye and part
I'll always keep you in my heart
With me, Lili Marlene
With me, Lili Marlene
Give me a rose to show how much you care
Tied to the stem, a lock of golden hair
Surely, tomorrow, you'll feel blue
But then will come a love that's new
For you, Lili Marlene
For you, Lili Marlene
When we are marching in the mud and cold
And when my pack seems more than I can hold
My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, Lili Marlene
It's you, Lili Marlene
My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, Lili Marlene
It's you, Lili Marlene

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know or haven't I told you so
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
You'll never know if you don't know now

My life was rosy as a lovely summer dawn
It's very different since the one I love has gone
Haven't seen a sunny day
Ever since he went away
Wonder when my baby is coming home
Haven't slept a wink at night
Just worrying if he's all right
Wonder when my baby is coming home
Oh, I really cann't help crying
I'm so hungry for his caress
Though I promised I wouldn't be crying
I'm not brave enough, I guess
Home will be a lonely place
Till I kiss that funny little face
Wonder when my baby is coming home
I wonder when my baby is coming home

Who is the loving daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair of lips, I'd like to try them for size
I'll just tell him, "Baby, won't you swing it with me"
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood"
First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said "Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me"
"Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood"
In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skipping
It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now"
In the mood for all his kissing
In the mood his crazy loving
In the mood what I was missing
It didn't take me long to say "I'm in the mood now"
So, I said politely "Darling may I intrude"
He said "Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood"
"Well" he answered "Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood"

Now I'm getting very fond of my gas mask I declare
It hardly ever leaves my sight
I sling it on my back and I take it everywhere
It even comes to bed at night
It's been a real good pal to me I must confess
And helped me out of many a mess
My sister had a lot of socks to mend
So she gave me a fat bouncing baby to tend
And when I felt it leaking at one end
Well I did what I could with my gas mask
I bought a farm because I like fresh air
At milking time I tried to do my share
And when I found the bucket wasn't there
Well I did what I could with my gas mask
The lady living next door, Mrs. `icks
She heard the sirens blow one morn at ten to six
She dashed outside in nothing but her nicks
But she knew what to do with her gas mask
By train I went for a very tiring ride
There wasn't any corridor outside
And when I felt the turning of the tide
Well I did what I could with My gas mask
To see old Echstien's Adam in the nude
I once thought I'd go with my Aunt Ermintrude
And when she sniffed and said "How very rude,
Still, he knows what to do with his gas mask
For years I courted Annabella Price
And always found her just as cold as ice
Until one night the lass forgot her Ma's advice
And I did what I could with my gas mask.

When the lights go on again all over the world
And the boys are home again all over the world
And rain or snow is all that may fall from the skies above
A kiss won't mean "goodbye" but "Hello to love"
When the lights go on again all over the world
And the ships will sail again all over the world
Then we'll have time for things like wedding rings and free hearts will sing
When the lights go on again all over the world
When the lights go on again all over the world

I wrote my Mother, I wrote my Father
And now I'm writing you too
I'm sure of Mother, I'm sure of Father
And now I want to be sure
Very, very sure
Of you
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me,
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home.
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me,
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
I just got word from a guy who heard
From the guy next door to me
The girl he met just loves to pet
And it fits you to a T
So don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
With anyone else but her, no, no, no
Not a single soul but me, no, no, no
Don't you sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Not till you see me
Not until you see me marching home
Home, home, home, sweet home
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me
With anyone else but her, no, no, no
Not a single soul but me, no, no, no
Don't you go walking down Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me
Not till you see me
Not until you see me marching home
Home, home, home, sweet home
Cann't wait till I come marching home
Don't go walking down Lovers' Lane
No walking down Lovers' Lane
Till you see me
When you see me marching home
Then we'll go arm in arm
We'll sit down under the apple tree
Baby just you and me
When I come marching home

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say, "I love you."
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman need man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman need man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night
The roses are sighing a Moonlight Serenade
The stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you and sing you a Moonlight Serenade
Let us stray till break of day
In love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky
A heavenly breeze kissing the trees
So don't let me wait, come to me tenderly in the June night
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight
A love song, my darling, a Moonlight Serenade

Private Jones came in one night
Full of cheer and very bright
He'd been out all day upon the spree
He bumped into Sergeant Smeck
Put his arms around his neck
And in his ear he whispered tenderly...
Kiss me goodnight, Sergeant-Major
Tuck me in my little wooden bed
We all love you, Sergeant-Major, 
When we hear you bawling, "Show a leg!"
Don't forget to wake me in the morning
And bring me around a nice hot cup of tea
Kiss me goodnight Sergeant-Major
Sergeant-Major, be a mother to me
Kiss me goodnight, Sergeant-Major
Tuck me in my little wooden bed
We all love you, Sergeant-Major
Even when your neck grows rather red
Don't forget to wake me in the morning
And bring me around a nice hot cup of tea
Kiss me goodnight, Sergeant-Major
Sergeant-Major, be a mother to me

He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now, a-blowing reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
A-toot, a-toot, a-toot-diddelyada-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playing with him
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He was some boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays the boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a "bzzz" bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
Toot toot toot-diddelyada, Toot-diddelyada, toot-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar
He cann't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with him
ha-ha-hand the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes them up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille
He's boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
Dat-da da-do-do da-dup
Dat-da da-do-do da-dup
Dat-da da-do-do da-dup
Dat-da da-do-do da-dup
ha-ha-hand the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

You should see me out in France wearing my tin hat
With shot and shell it's worse than – well it's even worse than that
Now imagine me in the Maginot Line
Sitting on a mine in the Maginot Line
Now it's turned out nice again
The Army life is fine
French girls make a fuss of me
I'm not French as you can see
But I know what they mean when they say "oui, oui"
Down on the Maginot Line
Now imagine me in the Maginot Line
Sitting on a mine in the Maginot Line
Now it's turned out nice again
The Army life is fine
The enemy we had to chase
But my gun got out of place
I went and shot the Colonel in the base
Down on the Maginot Line
Now imagine me in the Maginot Line
Sitting on a mine in the Maginot Line
Now it's turned out nice again
The Army life is fine
At night, myself to sleep I sing
To my old tin hat I cling
I have to use it now for everything
Down on the Maginot Line
Now imagine me in the Maginot Line
Sitting on a mine in the Maginot Line
Now it's turned out nice again
The Army life is fine
Suddenly a pain I felt
A doctor on my tummy knelt
He slapped a poultice underneath my belt
Right on the Maginot Line
Now imagine me in the Maginot Line
Sitting on a mine in the Maginot Line
Now it's turned out nice again
The Army life is fine
Hitler can't kid us a lot
His secret weapon's tommyrot
But you ought to see what the sergeant's got
Down on the Maginot Line
Down on the Maginot Line

We'll meet again
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away
So will you please say "Hello"
To the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Until the blue skies
Drive the dark clouds far away
So will you please say, "Hello"
To the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
